# Attic Weather Station

At the beginning of Summer 2025, I realized the upstairs of my house would get uncomfortably hot. Sometimes it would reach temepratures of over 80° F, which was far off my perfered 69° F. I would constantly check the thermostat, and it always was set to 69°, but the temperature would never lower. Eventually after some investigating, I found that the AC never blew cold air, only hot air. 

### But why was this?

I hypothesised that the attic may be getting very hot, where the AC unit lived. This would cause the AC unit to not function optimally, causing my house's hot temperatures. I figured I should do an investigation, and with spare parts laying around and my soldering iron, I created a small device to track and visualize the temperatures. 

### The device

This was built with a D1 mini ESP8266 and an Adafruit BME680. They are wired together on a breadboard and powered by a usb cable.
